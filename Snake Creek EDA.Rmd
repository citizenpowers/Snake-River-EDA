## Purpose  
The objective of this report is to provide summarize historical water quality (WQ) and hydrologic data from Snake Creek (C-9 Canal). This summary will be used for the design of water treatment technology facility. 


### About the Data

Historical WQ data was gathered from two inactive stations on Snake Creek, SK02 and SK09. Station SK09 is located approximately 3 miles upstream of the testing facility and SK02 is located at the outflow of Snake Creek at S29 structure (Figure 1). Unfortunately sampling at these stations was discontinued in 2014 so the data isn't very  current but it is better than no data. The hydrologic record is much more complete and current. Flow from the outflow of the river was measured at S29S and near the head of the river at S30C. All data was downloaded from the SFWMD's publicly available database https://apps.sfwmd.gov/dbhydroInsights/#/homepage 3/18/2025.

```


### Water quality and flow summaries

```{r Table 1, echo=FALSE }
knitr::kable(read_csv("Data/Snake_Creek_WQ_summary.csv"),caption = "Table 1: Summary Stats of SK09 and SK02") %>% kable_material(c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r Table 2, echo=FALSE }
knitr::kable( read_csv("Data/Snake_Creek_Flow_Summary.csv"),caption = "Table 2: Summary Stats of flow data from S29S and S30C") %>% kable_material(c("striped", "hover"))
```


### Seasonal Patterns and Relationships with Flow

```{r figure_2, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Seasonal TP"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("./Figures/Seasonal TP.jpeg","./Figures/TP vs Flow.jpeg"))
ggdraw() + draw_image("./Figures/Seasonal TP.jpeg", width = 0.5) + draw_image("./Figures/TP vs Flow.jpeg", width = 0.5, x = 0.5)
```
